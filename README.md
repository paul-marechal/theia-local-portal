# theia-local-portal

> I recommend using `pnpm` to setup this project

## Usage

The portal's CLI is `lib/cli.js`.

Run `node lib/cli.js --help` to see the available commands.

Note that the server will load and cache the current day's database on startup,
this means that you must restart the server in order to update sessions.
